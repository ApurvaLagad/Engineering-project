The main objective of this project is to enhance the AES and RSA encryption algorithms to achieve optimal performance in terms of low power consumption, high throughput, real-time processing, reliability, and robust security. By doing so, it ensures the protection of sensitive data while maintaining efficiency and seamless operation.  

To safeguard file data, all encrypted files are securely stored in the AWS Cloud, providing a highly scalable and protected environment for data storage. The encryption key is sent directly to the user's registered email ID, ensuring a secure and private method of key distribution.  

This implementation is developed entirely in Python, making it highly portable and easily adaptable across different systems. Moreover, to further enhance security, the decryption software is exclusively available to end users, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring complete data confidentiality.
